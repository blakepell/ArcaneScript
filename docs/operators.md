# Operators

Arcane supports a specific set of operators used in its scripting language. This section details the operators available.

## Assignment Operators
- `=`: Assigns the result of an expression to a variable.
- `+=`: Augmented assignment; adds the right-hand value to the variable and assigns the sum.

## Arithmetic Operators
- `+`: Adds two numbers or concatenates strings.
- `-`: Subtracts the right-hand operand from the left-hand operand.
- `*`: Multiplies two integers.
- `/`: Divides one integer by another (integer division).

## Relational Operators
- `<`: Returns true if the left-hand operand is less than the right-hand operand.
- `>`: Returns true if the left-hand operand is greater than the right-hand operand.
- `<=`: Returns true if the left-hand operand is less than or equal to the right-hand operand.
- `>=`: Returns true if the left-hand operand is greater than or equal to the right-hand operand.

## Equality Operators
- `==`: Checks if two values are equal.
- `!=`: Checks if two values are not equal.

## Logical Operators
- `&&`: Logical AND; true if both operands are logically true.
- `||`: Logical OR; true if at least one operand is logically true.
- `!`: Logical NOT; inverts the truth value of its operand.

## Increment/Decrement Operators
- `++`: Increments an integer variable (supports both prefix and postfix usage).
- `--`: Decrements an integer variable (supports both prefix and postfix usage).
